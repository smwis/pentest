# 1 Footprinting
## 1.1 Nmap
```
nmap -sS <ip-address/range/network>
```
TCP SYN -scan (stealth scan)
```
nmap -sn <ip-address/range/network>
```
Host discovery (no port scan)
```
nmap <ip-address/range/network> -T<0-5>
```
Scan timing. T5 is fastest, -T3 is default and -T0 slowest (IDS/IPS evasion)
